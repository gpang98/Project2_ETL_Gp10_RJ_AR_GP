    - the postgresql job used to generate the crowdfunding_db database.
    - the csv files (under Resource folder) are loaded to the individual table using Data Import making sure the header tick is selected.
    - The creation of the tables must followed this sequence (category, subcategory, contact and finally campaign).  The 1st three tables can be created in any order since they are independent with their respective Primary Key but campaign table has to be created last since it uses the primary keys from other tables as Foreign Keys.
    - The same sequence is also used to do data loading.  The 1st three can be in any order but campaign table is the last to be loaded using the Data Import csv option.

    - consist of the original two files contact.xlsx and crowrdfunding.xlsx as data input and 
    - the 4 csv files (categrory, subcategory, contact and crowdfunding) generated using Step 1 codes and
    - later loaded into the postgresql database in Step 4.
ðŸ‘Œ6. **Checking_data_input.sql** - to check whether the CSV files have been loaded properly.
